    <h1>Limited Time Offer - Free Cup with Purchase at Dollar General to Support Local Food Drive & Pet Food Pantry</h1>
  <p>Are you interested in helping donate or give funds to the Armstrong Creek Food Drive? Starting on <strong>February 1, 2026</strong>, the town will be pairing with the Dollar General Store to raise money and food donations to help people (and animals) in need. For each purchase you make at the <strong>Dollar General Store</strong>, the store will donate half the item's price to the fundraiser, and in addition, for the first purchase you make you will receive a free cup of hot chocolate! This special offer is limited to February 1, but the fundraiser event will span over the next two weeks. All funds raised will be donated to help buy canned goods and other nonperishable food items.
  </p>
  <h2>Want to Help Even More?</h2>
  <p>Want to help us further? Bring any type of canned good or nonperishable item to donate at the front of the Dollar General store between Februray 1-15. Items will be stacked on the table in the front of the store, they will be sorted later and moved by volunteers on the 15th. If you'd like to volunteer to help, inquire at the register for more information. In addition to donating food to help people, we're also accepting food for animals to aid the animal shelter. See below for more information regarding accepted items.</p>
  <h3>Pet Food Pantry Items Accepted</h3>
    <p>Donations of any unopened and unexpired cat or dog foods are accepted, whether it's bags of dry food or canned wet food. All donations are appreciated!</p>
    <blockquote>We're very excited for the efforts the town will make and contribute for the benefit of others. We look forward to seeing how many contributions we can make to the community through these next few weeks, we hope to see everyone pitch in what they can!</blockquote><footer>-Amelia Cresshart</footer>
